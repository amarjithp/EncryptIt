# EncryptIt
EncryptIt is a python script which converts plain text into hashed format.

I have used a new hashing pattern in this script which makes this script different from others.

# Installation
# Kali
apt install python3

pip3 install pyfiglet

cd EncryptIt

python3 EncryptIt.py

# Termux
pkg install python3

pip3 install pyfiglet

cd EncryptIt

python3 EncryptIt.py
